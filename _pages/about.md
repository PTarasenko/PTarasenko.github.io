I am junior Data Scientist with a passion for Python (including **data mining**, **data analysis** and **machine learning**).

I hold a bachelor degree in Physics and Mathematics, majoring in Computer Science. I graduated from General Assemblyâ€™s Data Science Immersive course in May 2018.

I have always was passionate in Science and IT technologies. That was a reason why I decided to learn how I could combine this things together and contribute my skills to society. I very enjoyed all techniques in data mining and processing I learned at General Assembly. I want to focus on my machine learning skills which I could use to bring value to my future team.
